                            <p>To enhance driver awareness, I developed, integrated, and tested an attention guidance system that utilizes eye tracking data. The process involved various stages, starting with the analysis of requirements and the design and implementation of the system and integrating to the driving simulator. To validate the effectiveness of the system, I designed experiments and performed statistical analysis using Python. Additionally, we collaborated cross-functionally with UX designers to ensure a seamless user experience. Finally, I documented the technical aspects of the system and published the results to share our findings with the wider community.</p>

                            <p>In the realm of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems, I focused on the comprehensive design, development, and testing of human-centered models through a meticulous process. This entails designing and executing simulation scenarios as well as real-world driving experiments, precisely tailored to gather data that aligns with specific project requirements. Notably, I have achieved a significant milestone by successfully creating a real-time driver intention recognition model utilizing the power of Bayesian Networks. This cutting-edge model boasts an impressive accuracy rate of 85% specifically in roundabout scenarios, enabling our systems to anticipate and respond to driver intentions with remarkable precision. Seamless integration is at the core of our approach, as I meticulously implement interfaces that harmoniously merge our models with driver assistant systems and car simulators. Furthermore, we place great importance on documenting the methods employed within our libraries, ensuring transparency and facilitating ease of use. My commitment to customer satisfaction extends to providing comprehensive support, coupled with the opportunity to showcase our innovative solutions through product presentations and marketing endeavors at esteemed technology conferences.</p>
